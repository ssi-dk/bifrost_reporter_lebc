# Bifrost YAML Data Collection and Processing

This Python package was developed pipeline to **collect**, **parse**, and **filter** genomic analysis results from Bifrost-generated YAML files. It extracts data related to:

- **MLST**
- **AMR genes**
- **Plasmids**
- **Virulence genes**
- **Point mutations**
- **QC stampers**



## Package Structure

### `data_processing.py`

Contains utility functions to:
- Parse YAML outputs from Bifrost
- Filter based on coverage and identity thresholds
- Handle multiple analysis tools: `ariba`, `amrfinderplus`, `assemblatron`, `kma_pointmutations`, etc.
- Return cleaned results as pandas DataFrames



### `data_collection.py`

Handles:
- Reading a sample sheet (`.xlsx`)
- Validating sample directories and expected result files
- Calling parsing functions from `data_processing`
- Aggregating and returning dataframes
- Optional grouping by sample prefixes (e.g., batch/project IDs)

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python >3.8** and the required dependencies installed.

To install the package and script locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssi-dk/bifrost_reporter
cd bifrost_reporter
pip install .
```


## Input Requirements

###  Configuration file

A configuration file in YAML format able to point to the input file Excel sheets listing the Bifrost sample names.
The package will scan the dictory where the Excel sheet is stored for 

An example of how it is formatted :

```
project:
    name: "EQA"

Illumina:
    new:  "/xxx/xxx/xxx/sample_sheet.xlsx"
    original:  "/xxx/xxx/xxx/Illumina_original/sample_sheet.xlsx"
```

Where in this case `new` are the sample to be compared again `original`.

### Expected YAML Files per Sample

Each sample directory must contain:

- `__amrfinderplus_fbi.yaml`
- `__ariba_resfinder.yaml`
- `__ariba_virulencefinder.yaml`
- `__ariba_plasmidfinder.yaml`
- `__ariba_mlst.yaml`
- `__assemblatron.yaml`
- `__kma_pointmutations.yaml`
- `__ssi_stamper.yaml`
- `__reslab_stamper.yaml`
- (others like `__sp_ecoli_fbi.yaml`, `__whats_my_species.yaml` are optional)

## Usage


### 1. Run the Reporter

The config YAML file specifying paths to your sample sheets:

```bash
Illumina:
  new: /path/to/new/samples.xlsx
  original: /path/to/original/samples.xlsx
```

### 2. Run the Reporter

Use the installed command-line tool like this:

```bash
bifrost_reporter -c config.yaml -l report.log
```
